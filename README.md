2. Electrical Diagram (Control Plan, Power Plan)

The diagram below has been designed and developed using AUTOMATION STUDIO software: it is a circuit design, simulation, and project documentation software for hydraulic and electrical systems created by Famic Technologies Inc. This software is utilized for Computer-Aided Design (CAD), maintenance, and training purposes. It is primarily employed by engineers, trainers, and service and maintenance personnel.
